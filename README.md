# Disc-Golf-Heat-Map
Creates a disc golf shot heat map that can be used to determine where a disc golfer should be aiming on a given hole. The application takes a aerial photo of the hole and data points that hold the location of where the first throw went and what the disc golfer eventually scored on the hole.
